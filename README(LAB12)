Write a program to input sides of a triangle and check whether triangle is valid or not using if else.
A triangle is valid if sum of its two sides is greater than the third side. This means if a, b, c are three sides of a triangle. Then the triangle is valid if all three conditions are satisfied.
a + b > c and
a + c > b and
b + c > a
Ask the user for the sides of the triangle and output a message indicating that it is a valid or invalid triangle.
Use if, if else, and nested if statements. Do not use complex conditions (and, or).
